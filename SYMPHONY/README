*******************************************************************************
*                             USING SYMPHONY                                  *
*******************************************************************************

****************** Using SYMPHONY from the command line **********************

To use SYMPHONY as a generic solver, type the executable name on the command
line, followed by one or more of the command-line switches. On the
command-line, there is one required switch---you must specify the location of
the input file by using either "-F 'filename'" (MPS file or automatic
detection with file extension) or "-L 'filename'" (LP format). If the "-D"
switch is also present, the file will be assumed to be a GMPL model file with
the data file specified after the "-D" switch. In LINUX, the following command
would solve the instance "sample.mps"

symphony -F sample.mps

The remaining switches are used to set SYMPHONY's native parameters on the
command line. Below is a list of these parameters. This list can also be
obtained by executng 

symphony -h

Note that all SYMPHONY parameters are denoted by a lowercase letter. Many
other parameters can be set with the use of a parameter file (specified with
-f). These parameters are listed in the SYMPHONY user's manual.

symphony [ -FL file ] [ -f parameter_file_name ]
        [ -hd ] [-a 0/1] [-b 0/1 ] [-s cands] [-l 0/1] [ -q 0/1 ] [ -r 0/1]
        [-j 0/1 ] [ -e n ] [ -i iters ] [ -t time ] [ -g gap ] [ -n nodes ]
        [ -u ub ] [ -p procs ] [ -k rule ] [ -v level ] [ -c rule ]
        [ -m max ] [ -z n ] [-o tree_out_file] [-w 0/1]


        -F model: model should be read in from file 'model'
                  (MPS format is assumed unless -D is also present)
        -L model: LP format model should be read in from file 'model'
        -D data: model is in AMPL format and data is in file 'data'
        -T dir: run test with MIPLIB3 models
        -h: help
        -f file: read parameters from parameter file 'file'
        -d: stop at first feasible solution
        -a 0/1: whether to use primal heuristics
        -b 0/1: whether to use reliability branching
        -s cands: use at most 'cands' candidates for strong branching
        -l 0/1: whether to impose a limit on strong branching time
        -q 0/1: whether or not to tighten root bounds
        -r 0/1: whether or not to do reduced cost tightening
        -j 0/1: whether or not to generate cgl cuts
        -w 0/1: whether or not to use hot starting in strong branching
        -e n: set pre-processing level to 'n'
        -i iters: allow a max of 'iters' iterations in presolve
        -t time: set wallclock time limit to 'time'
        -g gap: set gap limit to 'gap'
        -n nodes: set node limit to 'nodes'
        -u ub: use initial upper bound 'ub'
        -p procs: allow 'procs' additional threads or processors
        -k i: use node selection rule 'i'
        -v n: set verbosity to level 'n'
        -c i: use rule 'i' to compare candidates
        -m max: allow a max of 'max' cuts to enter per iteration
        -z n: set diving threshold to 'n'
        -o file: output vbc-like tree information to file 'file'

************ Using the SYMPHONY interactive optimizer ************************

To use SYMPHONY's Interactive shell, run the executable name without any
command line arguments. Then type "help" or "?" to see a list of available
commands which are as follows for this version:

	load      : read a problem in mps or ampl format
	solve     : solve the problem
	lpsolve   : solve the lp relaxation of the problem
	set       : set a parameter
	display   : display optimization results and stats
	reset     : restart the optimizer
	help      : show the available commands/params/options	

	quit/exit : leave the optimizer

So, if you want to load and solve an ampl/gmpl file, you will need to type
"load sample.mod sample.dat" and then "solve". 

************************ Using the callable library **************************

To use SYMPHONY as a generic callable library, compile SYMPHONY as described
above. The library that is created along with the solver itself can be linked
to using the API described in the user's manual. For examples of using the
callable library in this way, see the Examples/ subdirectory.

*******************************************************************************
*                      DEVELOPING CUSTOM APPLICATIONS                         *
*******************************************************************************

To customize SYMPHONY by implementing the custom callback functions, simply
modify the files in the SYMPHONY/Applications/USER/ subdirectory, as described
in the user's manual and follow the compilation procedures in the file
SYMPHONY/Applications/USER/README. There are a number of sample applications
available as examples of how to do this kind of development with SYMPHONY.
These include solvers for the matching problem, the set partitioning problem
(simple and advanced versions), the vehicle routing and traveling salesman
problems, and the mixed postman problem. These applications are distributed as
separate packages and can be downloaded from http://www.branchandcut.org.
There is a white paper that guides the user through the development of the
matching solver.

*******************************************************************************
*                         CURRENT TESTING STATUS                              *
*******************************************************************************

SYMPHONY can now be used in a very large number of possible configurations and
we simply aren't able to test them all. Below is a rough idea of the testing
status of various configurations to date. If you need a certain configuration,
I would be happy to help you get it running. Please let me know.

LP INTERFACES
=============

**The native interfaces for OSL and CPLEX have now been deprecated**
**Only LP solvers with OSI interfaces are supported**

Well tested: CPLEX, CLP (through the Open Solver Interface) 

Well tested, but have some stability or other issues: GLPK

Compiled, but not well tested: SPX

TESTED CONFIGURATIONS
=====================

SEQUENTIAL

Known configurations that build and pass unit test

Sequential configurations are now automatically built and tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows using
 * [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/coin-or/symphony)
 * [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tkralphs/symphony)

SHARED MEMORY PARLLEL (OpenMP)

Builds and passes unit test with gcc 4 and 5 and CLP on LINUX.

DISTRIBUTED MEMORY PARALLEL (PVM)

Known configurations that build and pass unit test

- gcc 4.* on LINUX with PVM 3.4

APPLICATIONS
============

SYMPHONY (used as a generic MILP solver): Well tested.

MATCH (matching): Tested, but not very extensively.

MPP (mixed postman problem): Tested, but not very extensively.

VRP (vehicle routing problem): Well tested.

CNRP (capacitates network routing problem): Well tested.

MCKP (multi criteria knapsack problem): Well tested.

SPP (set partitioning problem): Tested, but not very extensively.

SPP+CUTS (set partitioning problem with cutting planes): Tested, but not very 
extensively.

CUT GENERATORS
==============

Cut generators are supplied by the Cut Generation Library (CGL). The cut
generators that are turned on by default have been well tested. Two cut
generators that are part ofthe CGL are turned off by default because of known
issues. These are lift and project cuts and the simple rounding cuts. The
generator for Gomory cuts works well, but has somenumerical issues. We found a
few cases where the optimal solution was not found when using the Gomory cut
generator, especially in combination with CPLEX. If the solver is not
performing as it should, try turning off some of the cut generators to see if
that fixes the problem. 

EXTERNAL COIN-OR LIBRARIES
==========================

See the Depdencies file for a list of the external COIN-OR libraries on which
SYMPHONY depends.

# Release 5.1.0:

 * SYMPHONY now has an interactive optimizer that can be used through a
command shell. In both the sequential and parallel configurations, the user
can set parameters, load and solve instances interactively, and display
results and statistics (see below).

 * SYMPHONY now supports automatic configuration using the new COIN-OR build
system and the GNU autotools.Using autotools utilities, it is now possible to
build SYMPHONY in most operating systems and with most common compilers
compilers without user intervention.

 * Both the distributed and shared memory parallel configurations are now
fully debugged, tested, and supported. The user can now build and execute
custom SYMPHONY applications in parallel, as well as solving generic MILPs in
parallel "out of the box."

 * There are now additional options for warm starting. The user can trim the
warm starting tree before starting to resolve a problem. More specifically,
the user can decide to initiate warm starting with a predefined partition of
the final branch-and-cut tree resulting from a previous solution procedure.
This partition can include either a number of nodes created first during the
solution procedure or all of the nodes above a given level of the tree.

 * The COIN-OR repository, the current host of SYMPHONY has recently undergone 
some significant improvements of its own that have resulted in improved 
services to users. These include: 

   * SYMPHONY has a new development Web site, where users can submit trouble
     tickets, browse the source code interactively, and get up-to-date
     information on development. The address of the new site is
     https://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY.

   * SYMPHONY is now hosted using subversion, a version control system with
     features vastly improved over CVS, the previous hosting software. This
     has required some reorganization and renaming of the header files.

   * SYMPHONY is now more tightly integrated with other COIN-OR projects. Due
     to improved procedures for producing stable releases, it will now be much
     easier for us to determine the exact version of SYMPHONY and all other
     COIN projects you are using when you report a bug.

   * SYMPHONY is now distributed with all COIN software needed to build a
     complete solver. Previously, other COIN softrware packages had to be
     downloaded and installed separately.

 * Two features have been deprecated and are no longer supported:

   * The native interfaces to OSL and CPLEX are now deprecated and no longer
supported. These solvers can be called through the COIN-OR OSI interface.

   * Column generation functionality has also been officially deprecated. For
     now, there are a number of other software packages that offer better
     functionality than SYMPHONY for implementing branch and price algorithms.

 * CHANGES TO THE USER INTERFACE (FROM SYMPHONY 5.0)

   * There was one minor change to the user callback API from version 5.0 to
     5.1. The user can now execute a primal heuristic in the
     user_is_feasible() callback and return the solution to SYMPHONY. The API
     for the user_is_feasible() subroutine is now
     ```C
     int user_is_feasible(void *user, double lpetol, int varnum, int *indices,
		          double *values, int *feasible, double *objval,
		          char branching, double *heur_solution)
     ```
Any feasible solution can be passed (in dense format) through the last
argument to this function.

   * Several new subroutines were added to the callable library API.

   * The name of the header file containing the SYMPHONY API has been changed
     from ```symphony_api.h``` to ```symphony.h``` (though the former has been
     retained for backword compatibility purposes).
